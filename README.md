You guys had an 'Other URL' section and this seemed relevant...


Hi Edenworks! Ive had an interest in Aquaponics that I think is left over from my year and a half as a biology major before I switched to Computer Science. From late 2013 to mid 2015 I built what seemed like a huge aquaponics system (~200 gallons) in my basement with the intention of making the system 'data-driven' by outfitting it with tools from [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/). The project, while never providing me any 'resume-grade' benefit, allowed me to play with photospectrometers (Public Lab sells fun little ones), embedded programming, and fish! Eventually I had to stop the project because it took a tremendous amount of energy to dehumidify the space (which I had to do to avoid mold eating my house from the basement up) and I couldnt afford LED lighting.

While I never got to the point that the system was fully automated I was able to leave it unattended for at least a week as the lighting timing, pump/siphon system, and feeding were automated.
